How To Use
======
If you've tried to launch the main.py without doing the following step
you probably stumbled across an ImportError telling you to come here.
You just have to execute this command :
```shell
cp keys.py.sample keys.py
```
And then you can paste your own keys in each variable without changing their name.
If you don't you won't be able to connect to the Twitter API.
